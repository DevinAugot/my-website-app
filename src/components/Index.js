        <p id="AboutMe">
          Hey, Thanks for coming to my portfolio website! My name is Devin, I'm
          currently a student in Keyin College's Software Development program.
          This has been a life changing journey for me as I personally have
          always worked in the trades industry for many years repairing and
          painting cars as an Autobody Technician but when covid hit and work
          was scarce I felt it was time for a change and theres always room to
          grow as a person and start new endeavours. That being said, I've also
          worn many hats so to speak throughout the year's too many to list in
          fact but I've been trying to find my true calling and since I've taken
          this program its been a life changing journey to say the least. This
          program has challenged me and made me think in ways I never knew I was
          capable of but most of all its sparked a passion within me that I
          wasnt aware of until I pursued this line of work as a devloper, it has
          opened my eyes to the fact that I can solve complex problems with
          critical thinking and a little wit. Most of all its made me passionate
          about building products and programs for people that could potentially
          make their daily life easier or make someones complex issue an easy
          one with a program or product that I created! The sky is the limit for
          me and I can't wait to see what the future holds!
